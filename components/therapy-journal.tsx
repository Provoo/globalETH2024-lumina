Hello?\" consider stating your name or the purpose of your communication to maintain engagement.\n\n3. Use a confident tone: Practice speaking with assurance, even when testing technology or connections, to instill confidence in your audience.\n\n4. Structure your message: Clearly outline what you need to communicate, such as the purpose of the test and any specific details, to keep your audience informed.\n\n5. Practice active listening: If you are unsure whether others can hear you, pause and listen for their responses before continuing, ensuring a two-way communication flow."
